## 📌 Overview
This project uses **Tableau** to analyze retail sales data provided by **Maven Analytics**, focusing on sales across **regions, cities, product categories, and time**.

The main goal of this dashboard is to help decision-makers:
- Understand **sales performance and profitability**.
- Identify **high-performing and low-performing regions or cities**.
- Spot trends in **product categories and sub-categories**.
- Discover where **discounts and high sales don’t translate to profits**.

The dashboard answers questions like:
- Which regions and cities are meeting their sales goals?  
- What are the sales and profit trends over time?  
- Which product categories are driving revenue?  
- Where are losses happening despite strong sales?
